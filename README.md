# Animal Shelter Management Database Project
Our DBMS centers around an adoption shelter for animals. We model various information related to the shelter, such as the different animals, workers, 
events hosted, and the animalsâ€™ health information. Thus, our domain for this application is animal shelter management and logistics.
